# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# #### This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply and then add integers.

# In[5]:


result = (3 * 4) + 5
result


# #### This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60

# In[6]:


minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
hours
